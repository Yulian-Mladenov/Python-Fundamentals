# this down is the code which is giving 100 from 100 points in Judge:
# name_1 = input()
# name_2 = input()
# delimiter = input()
#
# print(f'{name_1}{delimiter}{name_2}')


# this is a bit modified by me:
first_name = input("Enter first name: ")
second_name = input("Enter second name: ")
family_name = input("Enter family name: ")
delimiter = input("Enter delimiter: ")

print(f'{first_name} {delimiter} {second_name} {delimiter} {family_name}')
