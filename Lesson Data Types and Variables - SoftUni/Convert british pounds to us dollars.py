# # This approach give 100 from 100 points in Judge system:
# british_pounds = int(input())
#
# dollars_value = 1.31
#
# pounds_converted_in_dollars = british_pounds * dollars_value
#
# print(f'{pounds_converted_in_dollars:.3f}')


# This approach is modified by me a bit:

british_pounds = int(input('Please,input your amount of GBP: '))

dollars_value = 1.31
pounds_converted_in_dollars = british_pounds * dollars_value

print(f'This amount is the equivalent in USD: {pounds_converted_in_dollars:.3f}')
